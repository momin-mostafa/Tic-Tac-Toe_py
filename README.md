# Tic-Tac-Toe_py

This is a python script type console game.

I wrote this game to revise my python skills.

What I learned from this:
I learned,
1)How to use global variables in functions.
2)How to configure atom editor.
3)How to use trello
4)How to use git command lines.

:) this was a fun project.
